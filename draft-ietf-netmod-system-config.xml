    <abstract>
      <t>The Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) in RFC 8342
      defines several configuration datastores holding configuration. The
      contents of these configuration datastores are controlled by clients.
      This document introduces the concept of system configuration datastore
      holding configuration controlled by the system on which a server is
      running. The system configuration can be referenced (e.g., leafref) by
      configuration explicitly created by clients.</t>

      <t>This document updates RFC 8342.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) <xref
      target="RFC8342"/> defines system configuration as the configuration
      that is supplied by the device itself and appears in &lt;operational&gt;
      when it is in use (Figure 2 in <xref target="RFC8342"/>).</t>

      <t>However, there is a desire to enable a server to better expose the
      system configuration, regardless of whether it is in use. For example,
      some implementations defines the system configuration which must be
      referenced to be active. NETCONF/RESTCONF clients can benefit from a
      standard mechanism to retrieve what system configuration is available on
      a server.</t>

      <t>Some servers allow the descendant nodes of system-defined
      configuration to be configured or modified. For example, the system
      configuration may contain an almost empty physical interface, while the
      client needs to be able to add, modify, or remove a number of descendant
      nodes. Some descendant nodes may not be modifiable (e.g., the interface
      "type" set by the system).</t>

      <t>This document updates the NMDA defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>
      with a read-only conventional configuration datastore called "system" to
      expose system-defined configuration. The solution enables configuration
      explicitly created by the clients to reference nodes defined in
      &lt;system&gt;, override system-provided values, and configure
      descendant nodes of system-defined configuration.</t>

      <t>The solution defined in this document requires the use of NMDA for
      both clients and servers. Conformance to this document requires NMDA
      servers implement the "ietf-system-datastore" YANG module (<xref
      target="system-datastore"/>).</t>

      <section title="Updates to RFC 8342">
        <t>This document updates <xref format="none" target="RFC8342">RFC

        hold system configuration (<xref target="system-ds-def"/>), it also
        redefines the term "conventional configuration datastore" from <xref

        configuration datastores.</t>

        <t>Configuration in &lt;running&gt; is merged with &lt;system&gt; to

        transformations (e.g., template expansion, removal of inactive
        configuration defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>) have been
        performed, as described in <xref target="conceptual-model"/>.</t>

        <t>This document also updates the definition of "intended" origin
        metadata annotation identity defined in <xref section="5.3.4"
        sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8342"/>. The "intended" identity of
        origin value defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/> represents the origin
        of configuration provided by &lt;intended&gt;, this document updates
        its definition as the origin source of configuration explicitly
        provided by clients, and allows a subset of configuration in
        &lt;intended&gt; that flows from &lt;system&gt; yet is not configured
        or overridden explicitly in &lt;running&gt; to use "system" as its

    </section>

    <section anchor="categories" title="Kinds of System Configuration">
      <t>This document defines two types of system configuration.
      Configuration that is immediately-present and configuration that is
      conditionally-present. These types of system configuration are described
      in <xref target="immediate"/> and <xref target="conditional"/>,
      respectively.</t>

      <section anchor="immediate" title="Immediately-Present">
        <t>Immediately-present refers to system configuration which is
        generated in &lt;system&gt; when the device is powered on,
        irrespective of physical resource present or not, a special
        functionality enabled or not. An example of immediately-present system
        configuration is an always-existing loopback interface.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="conditional" title="Conditionally-Present">
        <t>Conditionally-present refers to system configuration which is
        generated in &lt;system&gt; based on specific conditions being met in
        a system. For example, if a physical resource is present (e.g., an
        interface card is inserted), the system automatically detects it and
        loads associated configuration; when the physical resource is not
        present (an interface card is removed), the system configuration will
        be automatically cleared. Another example is when a special
        functionality is enabled, e.g., when a license or feature is enabled,
        specific configuration may be created by the system.</t>

    <section anchor="system-ds-def"
             title="The System Configuration Datastore (&lt;system&gt;)">
      <t>Following guidelines for defining datastores in the <xref section="A"
      sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8342"/>, this document introduces a new
      datastore resource named "system" that represents the system
      configuration. NMDA servers compliant with this document MUST implement
      a system configuration datastore, and they SHOULD also implement
      &lt;intended&gt;.</t>

          <t>Name: "system".</t>

          <t>YANG nodes: all "config true" data nodes up to the root of the
          tree, generated by the system.</t>

          <t>Management operations: The datastore can be read using network
          management protocols such as NETCONF and RESTCONF, but its contents

          protocols.</t>

          <t>Origin: This document does not define any new origin identity.
          The "system" identity of origin metadata annotation <xref

          provided by the system.</t>

      <t>The system configuration datastore doesn't persist across
      reboots.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="conceptual-model" title="Conceptual Model of Datastores">
      <t>Clients may provide configuration nodes that reference nodes defined
      in &lt;system&gt;, override system-provided values, and configure
      descendant nodes of system-defined configuration in &lt;running&gt;, as
      detailed in <xref target="dynamic"/>.</t>

      <t>To ensure the validity of &lt;intended&gt;, configuration in
      &lt;running&gt; is merged with &lt;system&gt; to become
      &lt;intended&gt;, in which process, configuration appearing in
      &lt;running&gt; takes precedence over the same node in &lt;system&gt;.
      Since it is unspecified how to merge configuration before
      transformations, if &lt;system&gt; or &lt;running&gt; includes
      configuration that requires further transformation (e.g., template
      expansion, removal of inactive configuration defined in <xref
      target="RFC8342"/>) before it can be applied, configuration
      transformations MUST be performed before &lt;running&gt; is merged with
      &lt;system&gt;.</t>

      <t>Whenever configuration in &lt;system&gt; changes, the server MUST
      also immediately update and validate &lt;intended&gt;.</t>

      <t>As a result, Figure 2 in <xref section="5" sectionFormat="of"
      target="RFC8342"/> is updated with the below conceptual model of
      datastores which incorporates the system configuration datastore.<figure

      <t>Configuration in &lt;system&gt; is undeletable to clients (e.g., a
      system-defined list entry can never be removed), even though a node
      defined in &lt;system&gt; may be overridden in &lt;running&gt;. If it is
      desired to enable a client to delete system configuration, it can be
      approximated using &lt;factory-default&gt;, as described in <xref
      target="factory"/>. If system initializes a value for a particular leaf
      which is overridden by the client with a different value in
      &lt;running&gt; (<xref target="modifying"/>), the node in
      &lt;running&gt; may be removed later, in which case system-initialized
      value defined in &lt;system&gt; may still be in use and appear in
      &lt;operational&gt;.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Static Characteristics">
      <section title="Read-only to Clients">
        <t>The system datastore is read-only (i.e., edits towards
        &lt;system&gt; directly MUST be denied), though the client may be
        allowed to provide configuration that overrides the value of a
        system-initialized node (see <xref target="modifying"/>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="No Impact to &lt;operational&gt;">
        <t>This work has no impact to &lt;operational&gt;. Notably, it does
        not define any new origin identity as it is able to use the existing
        "system" identity defined in <xref section="5.3.4" sectionFormat="of"
        target="RFC8342"/>. This document does not assert that all
        configuration nodes in &lt;operational&gt; with origin "system"
        originate from &lt;system&gt;, especially in cases where it is
        ambiguous which origin should be used. &lt;system&gt; enables
        system-generated nodes to be defined like configuration, i.e., made
        visible to clients in order for being referenced or configurable prior
        to present in &lt;operational&gt;. "config false" nodes are out of
        scope, hence existing "config false" nodes are not impacted by this
        work.</t>

    <section anchor="dynamic" title="Dynamic Behaviors">
      <section title="May Change via Software Upgrades or Resource Changes">
        <t>The contents of &lt;system&gt; MAY change dynamically under various
        conditions, such as license change, software upgrade, and
        system-controlled resources change (see <xref target="conditional"/>).
        The updates of system configuration may be obtained through YANG
        notifications (e.g., on-change notification) <xref
        target="RFC8639"/><xref target="RFC8641"/>.</t>

        <t>Servers MUST ensure that any updates of &lt;system&gt; do not
        render &lt;intended&gt; invalid. However, any mechanism for handling
        these circumstances is outside the scope of this document. That said,
        here are some examples of how a server might behave ensuring
        &lt;intended&gt; (and &lt;running&gt;) remains valid: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Servers migrate references in &lt;running&gt; from old
            system-defined nodes to new system-defined nodes, assuming that
            the new references have the same semantic properties as the old
            reference. Since this migration changes data in &lt;running&gt;,
            it is RECOMMENDED to alert clients that such change may occur.</t>

            <t>Servers copy referenced system-defined node into
            &lt;running&gt;. Since this migration changes data in
            &lt;running&gt;, it is RECOMMENDED to alert clients that such
            change may occur.</t>

            <t>Servers reject the operation to change system configuration

        configuration nodes at the corresponding level in &lt;system&gt;.
        Configurations defined in &lt;running&gt; take precedence over system

        <t>The system datastore is defined as a conventional configuration
        datastore and shares a common datastore schema with other conventional
        datastores.</t>

        <t>The following diagram illustrates the relationship amongst the
        "identity" statements defined in the "ietf-system-datastore" and

      target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis"/>.</t>

      <t>The "ietf-system-datastore" YANG module defines a data model that is
      designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
      NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.
      These protocols have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH <xref
      target="RFC4252"/>, TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, and QUIC <xref
      target="RFC9000"/>) and have to use mutual authentication.</t>

      <t>The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref
      target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to restrict access for particular
      NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
      NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.</t>

      <t>The YANG module only defines a identity that uses the
      "ds:conventional" identity as its base. The module by itself does not
      expose any data nodes that are writable, date nodes that contain
      read-only state, or RPCs. As such, there are no additional security
      issues related to the YANG module that need to be considered.</t>

      illustration purposes.</t>

      <section title="Device Powers On">
        <t>When the device is powered on, suppose the system provides an
        immediately-present loopback interface (named "lo0") which is not
        explicitly configured in &lt;running&gt;. Thus, no configuration for
        interfaces appears in &lt;running&gt;;</t>

        <t>And the contents of &lt;system&gt; are:</t>

        <t>In this case, the configuration of loopback interface is only
        present in &lt;system&gt;, the configuration of interface in

        above.</t>

        <t>And &lt;operational&gt; will show the system-provided loopback
